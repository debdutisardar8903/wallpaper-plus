## 🎯 **Search Algorithm Details**

### **Matching Logic:**
```javascript
// Searches in order of priority:
1. Title contains search term → High relevance
2. Category matches search term → Medium relevance  
3. Tags contain search term → Medium relevance
4. Author name contains search term → Low relevance

// Multiple terms are treated as OR operations
// "mountain sunset" finds wallpapers with either term
```

### **Relevance Scoring:**
```javascript
// Results sorted by:
1. Exact title matches (highest priority)
2. Partial title matches
3. Category matches  
4. Tag matches
5. Author matches
// Within same relevance level: sorted by views (popularity)
```
