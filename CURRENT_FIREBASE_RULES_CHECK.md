# Check Current Firebase Rules

## 🔍 Verify Your Current Rules

1. **Go to Firebase Console:**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select: `wallpaper-plus-web`
   - Go to: Realtime Database → Rules

2. **Check if you see:**

### ❌ **If you see default rules like this:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": false,
    ".write": false
  }
}
```
**→ Rules are blocking everything! Apply the fix above.**

### ❌ **If you see complex validation rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "userUploads": {
      "$uid": {
        ".validate": "newData.hasChildren(['title', 'imageUrl'...])"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**→ Validation is too strict! Apply the simple rules above.**

### ✅ **If you see simple auth-only rules:**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "userUploads": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
**→ Good! This should work.**

## 🚨 Most Common Issue

**You probably have the complex validation rules still active.**

**Quick Fix:** Replace with the simple rules from Step 1 above.

## ✅ After Rules Applied

You should see in console:
- ✅ "Attempting to save to database..."
- ✅ "Successfully saved upload with key: xyz123"
- ✅ No permission denied errors
